# FRONT_END_ASSESSMENT_STUDENT_PROFILES
The goal of this assessment is to replicate the frontend application below as close as possible. You are allowed to use any frontend framework (React.js, Vue.js, etc.) or use plain Javascript, HTML, and CSS. We recommend using a frontend framework as the later parts of the assessment will be very difficult without it.
